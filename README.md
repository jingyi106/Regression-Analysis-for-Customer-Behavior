# App or Website, where should we put efforts to engage users
This is a data science project related to customer behavior.

## Background
An ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

This project focuses on applying linear regression model to compare and interpret the importance of app and website on impacting users' engagement

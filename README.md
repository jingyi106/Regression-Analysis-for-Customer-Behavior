# App or Website, where should we put efforts to engage users
This is a data science project related to customer behavior.

## Background
An ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

This project focuses on applying linear regression model to compare and interpret the importance of app and website on impacting users' engagement

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Correlation Analysis
2. Regression Analysis
3. Pair Plot
4. Heatmap
5. Joint Plot

### Model
Linear Regression

1. Result Interpretation (Causal Inference, t-test)
2. Residual Analysis
3. Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

### Business Insights
1. Time on App is much more important than Time on Website. To improve user engagement (imporve amount spent), the company should put more efforts in developing App. Time on website isn't statistically significant and we cannot conclude there is causal-inference relationship between Time on App and Yearly Amount Spent
2. There is a strongly positive relationship between Length of Membership and Yearly Amount Spent, so we suggest engaging more member to promote comsumption
